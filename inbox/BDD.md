> BDD is designed to test an application’s behavior from the end user’s standpoint, whereas [[TDD]] is focused on testing smaller pieces of functionality in isolation. In the prior example, the TDD test asserts the result of a specific method, while the BDD test is only concerned about the result of the higher level scenario.
